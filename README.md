 macOS
An installer for the latest version is available for Mac OSX / macOS: glogg-latest-installer.dmg

The binary is tested on 10.9 (Mavericks) upwards.

Please note glogg is not signed, recent versions of macOS might therefore show a dialog signalling glogg is from an “unidentified developer” and cannot be open. If you trust glogg, you can go around this dialog by opening Finder, going to Applications, Control + click on glogg and select Open. macOS will then register an exception for glogg. See this Apple support article for details.

 Windows
Up to date Windows installers are available:

64 bits (recommended): glogg-latest-x86_64-setup.exe.
32 bits (older v1.0.3 only): glogg-v1.0.3-setup.exe.
It is safe to install over an existing version if you want to update glogg to the latest version.
